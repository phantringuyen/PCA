### Multivariate Statistical Analysis
# Principle Component Analysis
- This project of [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) by [Python](https://www.python.org/) learn show how to create a complete system of **Multivariate Statistical Analysis**

### 2. WorkSpace
- Support Software: Visual Studio Code, Google Colabotary, Github.
- One of the most common challenges in data analysis (text, image, video, etc.) is the multidimensionality and sparsity of the data. Instances often arise where the number of data points is very small, but each point has a large number of features.
- The MNIST dataset, part of a comprehensive database containing handwritten digit images, serves as an illustrative example. This dataset is widely utilized for training various machine learning models.
  - Number of training images: 60,000
  - Number of test images: 10,000

- To perform basic image processing according to user needs from [OpenCV library](https://opencv.org/).
- Installing the **Edge detection algorithm** with the algorithms learned in class and comparing it with the library-supported function.
