### Multivariate Statistical Analysis
# Principle Component Analysis
- This project of [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) by [Python](https://www.python.org/) learn show how to create a complete system of **Multivariate Statistical Analysis**

### 2. WorkSpace
- To perform basic image processing according to user needs from [OpenCV library](https://opencv.org/).
- Installing the **Edge detection algorithm** with the algorithms learned in class and comparing it with the library-supported function.

### 3. Algorithms included:
- Transform colour
- Transform geometry
- Smooth the image (image blurring, image smoothing)
- Edge detection algorithm
